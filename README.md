Boost.Asio:  Boost.Asio supports a variety of network protocols, including ICMP, TCP, and UDP, and it can manage other resources such as serial ports, file descriptors, and even regular files.

Boost.Beast: This is a library built on top of Boost.Asio that provides implementations of HTTP and WebSocket.

Boost.Mysql

Boost.Redis: Redis (which stands for Remote Dictionary Server) is a popular in-memory data structure store, used in database, cache, and message broker applications. This library implements Redis plain text protocol RESP3. It can multiplex any number of client requests, responses, and server pushes onto a single active socket connection to the Redis server.
rking with large JSON payloads, there is support for incremental parsing, so you can feed data to the parser as it arrives over the network.

Boost.Url: Parses URL strings into components (scheme, user info, host, port, path, query, and fragment), and provides support for building URLs piece by piece. Also, there is support for modifying an existing URL (changing the query parameters, for example) and handling percent-encoded characters. This library basically makes even complex URLs easy to work with.
